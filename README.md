 # 🧠 Microwave Oven Simulation using PIC Microcontroller

This project simulates the working of a basic **microwave oven** using a **PIC16F877A microcontroller**. It is developed using **embedded C** in **MPLAB X IDE** and simulated using **PicSimlab** . The system mimics key functions of a microwave including:
- Timer-based cooking
- LCD countdown display
- Start/Stop buttons
- Rotating Fan
- Buzzer alarm when cooking is complete

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how embedded systems are used in modern home appliances for real-time control, user interaction, and safety.
